          Housing, bunching, and matching: The Stamp Duty Land Tax and its effects on the housing market.
      <p style="font-size: 10pt;">This paper demonstrates the positive impact of replacing notches with kinks in property transaction taxes, using the 2014 SDLT reform as a case study. The findings reveal significant changes in transaction and listing behaviors, elimination of welfare losses, and the effect of taxes on match quality and mobility. Regional heterogeneity in responses to the 250K notch is explained through a search and matching model. The paper recommends implementing discontinuous taxes like SDLT with consideration of market structures, advocating for replacing notches with kinks due to their minimal revenue cost and positive effects.</p

          What drives crime, Unemployment or Inequality?
        </a>
        <p style="font-size: 10pt;">TThis paper examines the link between unemployment, inequality, and crime in the U.S., finding that while trade competition doesn't affect arrest rates, task routinization does, particularly increasing arrests among adult men for violent crimes and gambling. The study suggests that inequality is the key mechanism behind this rise, highlighting the need for policymakers to address income inequality and protect workers affected by technological changes.</p>

          Did low-skilled men crowd low-skilled women out of the UK labor market?
      </li>
      <p style="font-size: 10pt;">This paper examines the impact of information and communications technologies (ICT) on employment in the UK, focusing on how ICT has polarized job opportunities by skill level and gender. It explores how low-skilled men, displaced from blue-collar jobs, have moved into interpersonal occupations, potentially displacing low-skilled women, mirroring trends observed in the U.S. labor market.</p>

          Hidden figures behind two-vehicle crashes: An assessment of the risk and external costs of drunk driving in Spain. Accident Analysis & Prevention, 127, 42-51.  Coauthored with Jesús Rodríguez-López and Yolanda Rebollo-Sanz
        </a>
        <p style="font-size: 10pt;">This paper estimates the increased risk of crashes caused by drunk drivers in Spain (2.7-3.9 times higher at night) and suggests that fines of €1250 could offset the external costs of drunk driving, which have declined since the introduction of stricter penalties in 2006.</p>
